# fingerPicker
fingerPicker is simply a tool for randomizing finger picking patterns between 3 to 8 eighth-values long on guitar. It can provide inspiration for writing, or just great technical practice.

I aim to build this into a web interface and perhaps add some more flexible features to give users a little bit more control over the randomization process.

## How to use this app

-the following commands randomly generate tabs for their respective instrument
- guitar: run `$node -e 'require("./fingerPicker").standardGuitar()'`
- ukulele: run `$node -e 'require("./fingerPicker").ukulele()'`
- pick up your instrument and read the tabs
- play it over your favorite chord progressions
- string plucks are denoted by `-0-`
- rests are denoted by `-=-`
- practice many variations of patterns and improve your playing vocabulary
- try writing some music
- enjoy
