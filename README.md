# fingerPicker
fingerPicker is simply a tool for randomizing finger picking patterns on guitar. It is a fun tool for improving your right hand technique. Currently, it's only functionality is providing a new pattern to practice each time you run `node fingerPicker.js` from the fingerPicker directory.

So far, this project has just been a practice in writing logic. However, I intend to build this into a web interface and perhaps add some more flexible features to give users a little bit more control over the randomization process.
