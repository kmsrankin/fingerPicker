# fingerPicker
fingerPicker is simply a tool for randomizing finger picking patterns between 3 to 8 eighth-values long on guitar. It can provide inspiration for writing, or just great technical practice.

I aim to build this into a web interface and perhaps add some more flexible features to give users a little bit more control over the randomization process.

## How to user this app

- run `$node fingerPicker.js` to randomly generate a finger-picking pattern
- pick up your guitar and read the tabs
- string plucks are denoted by `-0-`
- rests are denoted by `-}-`
- improve your guitar skills
- try writing some music
- enjoy
